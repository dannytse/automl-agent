# Minimal requirements for AutoML-Agent using parse_openai (no vllm)
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt

# Core dependencies (REQUIRED)
openai>=1.0.0  # For parse_openai and NOT_GIVEN support
pandas>=2.0.0  # For data handling
num2words>=0.5.13  # Used in agent_manager for number formatting

# Web search and utilities (REQUIRED)
requests>=2.32.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0  # For HTML parsing
google-search-results>=2.4.2  # Provides serpapi module (pip install google-search-results)
validators>=0.28.0  # For URL validation

# LangChain for RAG/knowledge retrieval (REQUIRED if using knowledge retrieval)
langchain>=0.2.0
langchain_community>=0.2.0
langchain_text_splitters>=0.2.0

# Optional: For knowledge retrieval features (only if using RAG)
# arxivloader>=1.0.2  # For arXiv paper retrieval - uncomment if needed
# kaggle>=1.6.12  # For Kaggle notebook retrieval - uncomment if needed (requires ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json)

# Note: transformers will be installed automatically as a dependency of langchain_community
# if you use embeddings features. If you don't use RAG at all, you might be able to skip
# langchain dependencies, but they're imported in the code so keep them for now.
